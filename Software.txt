Software:
	It is developed using a programming lanuguage to meet a specific
	goal. It is set of programs that is designed to solve a real world
	problem or needs.

Java:
	Statically typed high level Object Oriented programming lanugage

	the datatypes needs to be mentioned before we store any values.
	All the commands / code that is written is in a language that we as humans speak (English)
	Orientation means perspective. We persue everything as an object


How are you?
are you? How - not in proper grammar

Kumusta Ka? - What language is this? (Filipino/Taglog)
				Translator
How are you?

Compiler - Check for the syntax (grammar)
Interpreter - Convert the intemediate code to machine understandable code.

Java is both compiled and interpreted

Step 1: OddEven.java
Step 2: javac OddEven.javac			- 1. ByteCode (.class)
									- 2. Compilation Error
Step 3: Execute the code to get converted into another intermediate language. 
			- 1. Output
			- 2. Logical Mistake - Runtime Error
			- 3. Logical Loopholes - Exceptions 

Create a source code and save it as .java
compile the .java file
Execute the code

Any text editors and save it as .java
c:\users\Muthu\Desktop\Test.java

javac c:\users\Muthu\Desktop\Test.java - absolute path

D:\> cd c:\users\Muthu\Desktop
C:\users\Muthu\Desktop\>javac Test.java - relative path

C:\users\Muthu\Desktop\> dir
Test.java 			--rx-rw
Test.class 			--rx-rw 		#bytecode

To Execute:
C:\users\Muthu\Desktop\>java ClassName
Hello World!
C:\users\Muthu\Desktop\>


JDK: Java Development Kit

	It is a combination / group of software that contains all the necessary resources required to develop and execute java programs.

	It internally contains Java Runtime Ennvironment (JRE) and other tools : javap, javac, etc...

JRE: Java Runtime Environment
	
	It is a set of software tools which are used to execute the java code.

	It is going to provide a runtime environment to execute the java applications

	It is the implmentation of Java Virtual Machine
	It also consists of libraries that JVM uses at runtime

	JDK contains JRE contains JVM

	JRE can be downloaded separately

JVM: Java Virtual Machine

	It is a set of software  that is implemented on JRE which interacts with the Operating system

	Converts byt code into machine instructions
	Responsible for allocating the memory space inside RAM
	
	Execute the programs that are written in other languages but which got compiled to java byte code.


Syntax and the Skeleton to write code

class ClassName{
	all possible codes
}


Object:
	It is a real-world physical entity that has mass, that occupies space, that can be touched, seen or experienced and has properties and behaviours.

	Properties are the one that describes the object
	variables

	Behaviours are the one that tells what action is perfomed
	methods

	An object can have multiple references.

	For an object to be created, class is required.

	Using a single class, it is possible to create more than one object.

	All those objects looks similar and hence called similar objects.

	If one object is modified or changed, the changes neither affects the other object nor the class.

	To create an object there are 5 ways and the most common way is using "new" keyword.

	Ojects will be created inside the heap memory.

Class:

	Blueprint or plan to create objects.

	It is a logical entity using which the objects are created.

	For the objects to have properties and behaviours, it has to be declared inside a class.
