Book Store System
   Design a book store system that allows users to manage and purchase books. 
   The system should include the following requirements:

  name (String): The unique name of the book.
  category (String): The category of the book.
  pages (int): The number of pages in the book.

Methods:

  addBook(Book book, int quantity): Adds a specified quantity of a book to the inventory.
  buyBook(String bookName, int quantity, double moneyPaid): Processes the purchase of books. It should check:
	- If the book is available in the inventory.
	- If the requested quantity exceeds the available stock.
	- If the amount paid is sufficient for the total cost of the books.
	- The method should return the change if the payment exceeds the total cost.
	- Use exceptions to handle errors for the above conditions.

Exception Handling
  The system should throw exceptions with relevant error messages when:
	- The requested book is not available.
	- The requested quantity exceeds the available stock.
	- The amount paid is insufficient.
	- Use try-catch blocks to catch exceptions and display error messages, ensuring that the program continues to run after an exception.

User Interaction
  Create a main method that:
	Allows users to interactively enter the name of the book they wish to buy, 
	the quantity, 
	and the amount of money they are paying.
	Continue prompting for input until the user decides to exit.
